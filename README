#Description

COLA runscripts is a library for running COLA (Colour Oriented Linear Algebra) which
makes propagators and correlation functions.

#Usage

- Set desired parameters in parameters.yml
- Run 
	python submit.py

- Use option -m to make only missing correlation functions 
- Various testing options also available
- No other scripts are intended to be run

#Features

- Easy submission of only missing correlation functions is available
- Can make correlation functions using any structure of quarks
- Custom source types are available
- Addition of custom particle operators easily available
- Only minimal propagators are made
- Existing propagators are not re-made

#Current problems

- Particle combinations with different hadronic charges cannot be submitted
as one job. The must be separated out. This is to be fixed.

#TODO

- Fix particle hadronic Landau projections (when COLA updates)
- Create Laplacian Eigenmodes dynamically within the job
- Add support for GADI job scheduler
- Implement production and use of loop props
