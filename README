#Description

COLA runscripts is a library for running COLA (Colour Oriented Linear Algebra) which
makes Laplacian eigenmodes, propagators and correlation functions.

#Virtual Environment

- To set up virtual environment and install dependencies
  run:

     	python3 -m venv env
	source env/bin/activate
	python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

- Entering virtual environment, run: source/env/bin/activate
- To leave virtual environment, run: deactivate
- To update virtual environment, re-run:
     	python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  while environment is active
  
#Usage

- Copy example_parameters.yml to parameters.yml and set parameters as desired
- Run 

	python submit.py

  from this directory
- Various testing options also available (-t)
- Various other command line specifications are also available (python submit.py -h)
- No other scripts are intended to be run
- Alternative parameters files should be placed in ./parametersFiles

#Features

- Can make correlation functions using any structure of quarks
- Custom source types are available
- Addition of custom particle operators easily available
- Only minimal propagators and eigenmodes are made

#Current problems

- Available c-shifting logic is currently limited

#TODO

- Make sinkvalues not a pain to deal with
- Get cfun existence checking available on specific structures
- Add more documentation, including explanations of all variable in parameters.yml
- Add testing scripts for easy testing of individual functions
- Implement production and use of loop props
- Make replacement in file paths much cleaner
